question: "Two paintings by a famous artist recently sold for a total of $120,000\n  at auction. How much will 6 paintings by the same artist sell for at auction? Explain your reasoning and how this situation relates to proportionality."
expectations:
  - ideal: Each painting might not sell for the same amount of money, which indicates non-uniformity.
    features:        
      bad:        
        - same|identical|equal|uniform
      good:        
        - different|differ|unequal|(\b(isn't|not)\b.*(same|equal))  
  - ideal: The number of paintings and the total selling price of the paintings co-vary, because both are variable quantities and change together. 
    features: 
      bad:        
        - \b(not|isn't|no|without)\b.*\b(related|relationship|change)\b

  - ideal: The ratio of the number of paintings and the total selling price of the paintings is not constant.
    features:
      bad:        
        - multiples
      good:

  - ideal: The relationship between the number of paintings and the total selling price is not proportional.
    features:
      bad:        
        - proportion
