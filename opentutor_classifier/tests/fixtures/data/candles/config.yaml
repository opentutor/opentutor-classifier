question: "Two identical candles, Candle A and Candle B, are lit at different times and each is burning at the same constant rate. When Candle A has burned 20 $$$mm|||millimeters$$$, Candle B has burned 12 $$$mm|||millimeters$$$. Do you think that the relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned is proportional? Also, explain why or why not."
expectations:
  - ideal: Each candle is identical and burning at a constant rate, which indicates uniformity.
    features:        
      bad:        
        - different|differ|unequal|(\b(isn't|not)\b.*(same|equal))
      good:        
        - constant|same|identical|equal|uniform
  - ideal: The length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned are variable quantities and change together.

  - ideal: The ratio of the length that Candle A has burned to the length that Candle B has burned is not constant, so it is not invariant.
    features:
      bad:

  - ideal: The relationship between the length that Candle A has burned and the length that Candle B has burned is not proportional.
