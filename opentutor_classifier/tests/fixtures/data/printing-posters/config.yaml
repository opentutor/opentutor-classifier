question: "When printing a photograph that is 10 cm wide and 16 cm high, 8 ml of toner is needed. Without distorting the picture, how much toner will be needed to print the same image on a poster that is 25 cm wide? Explain your answer."
expectations:
  - ideal: Quantities of width and height of similar rectangles are in a proportional relationship because their values are in the same ratio.

  - ideal: The area of the image determines the amount of toner needed, where the area and toner are in a proportional relationship.
