question: "Six workers can paint a house in 7 hours. If the workers all paint at  the same rate, is the number of hours to paint the same house directly proportional to the number of workers? Explain why or why not."
expectations:
  - ideal: Each worker paints at the same rate, which indicates uniformity between the number of workers and time to paint the house.
    features:        
      bad:        
        - different|differ|unequal|(\\b(isn't|not)\\b.*(same|equal))
      good:        
        - same|identical|equal|uniform  
  - ideal: The number of workers and time to paint one house are variable quantities and change together. 
    features: 
      bad:        
        - \b(not|isn't|no|without)\b.*\b(related|relationship|change)\b
      good:
        - (covary|covariance|co-variance|co-vary)|\b(same|equal|together)\b.*\b(change|vary|rate|decrease)\b|(change|vary|rate|decrease).*(same|together|equal)
  - ideal: The ratio between the number of workers and time to paint the house is not constant, indicating the relationship does not have invariance.
    features:
      bad:        
        - constant|equal|multiple
      good:
        - ((not\\040same|invariance|invariant|fixed|constant).*(multiple|ratio|number|unit\\040rate))
  - ideal: The relationship is not directly proportional. Instead, it is inversely proportional.
    features:
