question: "Buses-R-Us makes school buses with 30 seats. As the company makes more buses, is the relationship between the number of buses and the number of seats proportional? Explain why or why not."
expectations:
  - ideal: Each bus is identical and has 30 seats, which indicates uniformity.
    features:
      bad:
        - different|differ|unequal|(\b(isn't|not)\b.*(same|equal))
        - different
      good:
        - bus|seat(s)|30
        - \\040same|identical|equal|uniform
  - ideal: The number of buses and seats are variable quantities and change together.
    features:

  - ideal: The ratio of the number of buses to seats is constant, indicating invariance.
