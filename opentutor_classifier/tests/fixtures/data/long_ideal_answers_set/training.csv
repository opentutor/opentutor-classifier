0,Mixture A is the correct answer because the effect of a 1 part difference decreases as the total number of parts increases.,good
0,Mixture A is the correct answer. The shade of gray for each mixture is dependent on the ratio of green to red. The effect of a 1 part difference decreases as the total number of parts increases.,Good
0,"Mixture A is the darkest because it has a higher ratio of green to red. Additionally, the impact of a 1 unit difference decreases as the amount of each paint color increases",Good
0,Mixture C is the darkest shade of grey because the ratio of green to red is the highest of the three. ,Bad

0,"To determine if the given mixtures have darker shade of gray, we need to compare the ratio of green to red across the mixtures. We purposely selected these mixtures with 1 part difference because this is a key misconception students and sometimes teachers might have based on thinking additively. On the other hand, as we see in this activity, the ratio describes a multiplicative relationship between quantities. Because the number of green and red parts of a mixture are in a proportional relationship, the quotient of green and red, not the difference, determines the shade of gray.",Bad

0,"I think it's Mixture A would be the darkest shade of grey. It's the darkest shade of grey because the ratio of green to red paint is the greatest. Even though the other mixtures have more green, they don't have more green to red in the mixture. Mixture A has the most green for every one part red paint.",Good
