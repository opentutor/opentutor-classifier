question: "Sarah made the given three mixtures using red and green paint. Mixture A had 4 parts green and 3 parts red. Mixture B had 5 parts green and 4 parts red. Mixture C had 6 parts green and 5 parts red. Note that each mixture has one additional red and green part as compared to the last mixture. Assuming that adding more green to the mixture will make it darker, which of the mixtures is the darkest shade of gray? Please explain why."
expectations:
  - ideal: The shade of gray for each mixture is dependent on the ratio of green to red, so mixture A is the correct answer.
