question: What happens to a normal diode if when reversed-biased voltage is applied to it?
expectations:
  - expectationId: "0"
    ideal: "Normal diodes do not conduct current in reverse bias and act like an \"off\" switch."
    features:        
      bad:        
        - (damag|destr|ruin|burn|break|smoke|explod|splode|fail|fire|crack|short|overload)
      good:        
        - ((cannot|no|not|n't|n't|prevent).*(conduct|cunduct|conduc|conduck|allow|flo|flow|pass))|(off|disable|stop|deenergize|open|block)
  - expectationId: "1"
    ideal: The diode will be damaged by going into breakdown mode.
