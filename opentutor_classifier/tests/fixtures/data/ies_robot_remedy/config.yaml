question: "To move from slope to having an equation that can describe the distance traveled in any amount of time, let's consider line B. What is the y-intercept for Line B?"
expectations:
  - ideal: The y-intercept equals 0.
    features:        
      bad:        
        - 1|one
      good:        
        - 0|zero|origin
  - ideal: When a line goes through (0,0), its slope can be determined by any (x,y) pair, specifically y/x.
    features: 
      bad:        
        - none
      good:
        - distance\\040divided\\040by\\040time
        - distance\\040over\\040time
        - distance\\040by\\040time
        - any
  - ideal: For a proportional relationship, slope = unit rate.
    features:
      bad:        
        - depends

      good:
        - equivalent
