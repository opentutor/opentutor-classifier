0,"To determine if the given mixtures have darker shade of gray, we need to compare the ratio of green to red across the mixtures. We purposely selected these mixtures with 1 part difference because this is a key misconception students and sometimes teachers might have based on thinking additively. On the other hand, as we see in this activity, the ratio describes a multiplicative relationship between quantities. Because the number of green and red parts of a mixture are in a proportional relationship, the quotient of green and red, not the difference, determines the shade of gray.",Bad
