0,"If the battery's polarity is reversed, the diode becomes reverse-biased, and drops all of the battery's voltage leaving none for the lamp.",Bad
0,"Diodes nominally conduct electricity in one direction, and the voltage they apply follows a so-called forward bias orientation. If the voltage moves in the opposite direction, we call that orientation a “reverse bias.” In reverse bias, current flow is nominally blocked as a sort of electronic check valve.",Bad
